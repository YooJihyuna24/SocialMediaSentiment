Shame on you for forgetting your very much gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer trans brothers and sisters. Shame on you for forgetting that gender expression has always been a part of our community. And most of all, shame on you for being cowards who don’t have a back bone to stand up to bigotry. We have always been there. Fuck most of us came out as gay before figuring out we are trans. We are your fucking people. How dare you forget that.\n",
